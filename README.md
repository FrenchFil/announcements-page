I was responsible for frontend side of the project, im not taking any credits for backend side of it.
Im aware that its not a good quality project, but it was done for a university project when I was starting my journey with frontend.
There are some problems with estetics and functionality, after that one i focused on other projects and it just left behind.
I was running project on XAMPP, so i joined all of the files needed to run it on your own pc.
